# Phase Roadmap

Three design maturity phases. Each phase is a self-contained architecture — not an environment promotion.

| Phase | Maturity | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| **PHASE_1** | Foundation | Core patterns working locally — containers, secrets, logging |
| **PHASE_2** | Hardened | Security hardening, operational maturity — container tokens, network zones, envelope encryption, incident response |
| **PHASE_3** | Full Spec | Production-ready — all security tooling, full PKI hierarchy, forensic capture, solo operator safety |

## Topic Progression

| Topic | PHASE_1 | PHASE_2 | PHASE_3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Brainbox Runtime** | Docker | Docker | Docker + kind/vcluster |
| **Brainbox Hardening** | Basic (seccomp default, drop dangerous caps, read-only rootfs, non-root) | Full mandatory baseline (custom seccomp, drop ALL caps, AppArmor, PID isolation) | Full mandatory baseline |
| **Image Policy** | cosign keyless signing (CI) + keyless/key-based verification (brainbox), dev images with debugging tools | Distroless required, vulnerability scanning | Distroless required, approved base image policy, static binaries |
| **Identity** | No identity system — implicit trust, containers identified by Docker labels | Orchestrator-issued container tokens (agent name, task ID, capabilities, expiry) | Full SPIRE, SVID type policy (x509/JWT), aggressive TTLs, HSM root CA, deny-list revocation, replay protection |
| **Secrets** | 1Password + direnv, file-based tmpfs delivery | Envelope encryption (KEK/DEK), OIDC federation for CI | Full envelope encryption, break-glass procedure |
| **Orchestrator** | Single process: task dispatch, agent registry (now with role-based agents + multi-repo hub + Claude Code Teams), built-in policy, message routing | State persistence, degraded mode, token issuance | Resilience (watchdog, safe mode, dead-man switch) |
| **Communication** | Star topology, request/reply + events, internal delegation, in-memory message router (merged into Orchestration) | NATS message bus (circuit breaker fallback to in-memory), external delegation, broadcast | JetStream persistence, message replay, full delegation model, scope-based policy |
| **Network** | Docker bridge, basic egress allowlist (merged into Container Lifecycle) | Network zones (3-tier), default-deny between agents | Full zone isolation, SPIRE server isolation, Envoy bypass prevention |
| **Observability** | Structured JSON logs | Add distributed traces, data classification, redaction pipeline | Full redaction, hash-chained audit trail, WORM storage |
| **Shared State** | Vector DB + Artifact Store, direct access | MinIO artifact store, authenticated proxy, namespace isolation, signed writes, bucket notifications → webhook push (n8n/Jenkins) | Per-namespace encryption, quarantine, integrity background scans |
| **Security Tooling** | None — orchestrator built-in policy only | OPA + Kyverno | Full suite: Envoy, OPA, Cilium, Falco, Kyverno (all flaggable) |
| **Incident Response** | Container recycle is the response | IR runbooks, forensic capture before recycle | Full IR lifecycle, escalation matrix, known-good baseline |
| **Threat Model** | Container isolation is the primary control | Attack path analysis, risk quadrant | Full threat model with before/after risk assessment |
| **Operator Safety** | N/A — operator is at the keyboard | Basic monitoring | Dead-man switch, auto-safe-mode, backup contact |
